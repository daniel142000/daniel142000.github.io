<li>Charlie, an elderly pool cleaner, and Michael, a young gardener are both good
friends. Charlie is the one who introduces Michael to gardening. Even though
Michael lives a very measured and secured life, making enough money to take care
of his wife and children. He still thinks something is missing or feels that he can be
far more successful than he is, but he’s not quite sure how to achieve this. But
without even knowing, this becomes the major role that Charlie will play in his life by
advising him on how to achieve this success. Charlie passes down the knowledge he
gains from Mr. Davis, who has managed to achieve success in his own life. In Chapter
4, Charlie does this by teaching him the right way to set goals in his life, and the
importance of it when it comes to the achievement of his goals. He ensures to
emphasize that the real “gold” in setting goals is what you become in the process of
achieving them. As an individual, I can testify that this is factual. I have written down
some of my most major goals in a journal of mine, but I don’t just merely write. I try
to focus and visualize already achieving the goal with real genuine emotions
connected to it. There are even times when I have even cried while writing down
these goals on paper. Reading this chapter has reminded me of the importance of
goal setting, it has also pushed me to think of writing goals for some of the simpler
achievements in life.</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<li>In Chapter 5, Charlie goes further to tell Michael how proper time management
 will help him in becoming successful throughout his life. Like all of us, Michael 
 was struggling with finding the time to set and work towards any form of goals, because
 he was a very busy man, as it relates to work and taking care of his family. Charlie 
 instilled an image in his head by telling him how much regret he would face on his dying 
 bed knowing that he had not worked to achieve many of the things he dreamed of doing.
 He encourages him to make use of every day that he is given, as days are very expensive
 and cannot be bought back. He expresses that many opportunities can arise throughout 
 his days, but his time should be spent solely on those that align with his overall goals.
 I should confess that this is an area of my life that I’ve been working to master.
 If I was efficient and consistent In Managing my time I know without a doubt that
 I would be a lot more productive than I am now, therefore I’m continuously working 
 on bettering the way my time is spent.</li>	
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<li>In Chapter 6, Charlie continues to pass on his knowledge by advising Michael that 
he should also surround himself with successful people if he wishes to achieve the success
 of his own. He advises him to surround himself with people who positively give into his life,
 people who are driven and are also on the pursuit of achieving specific goals, and people who 
 share the same interests and are on the same path as he Is. Because aside from the actions
 and decisions that he makes, people in his life also have the ability to shape his destiny.
 This is something that I ensure to practice in my own life. I take much importance in the
 people that I allow to share experiences with me throughout life, my conscience just wouldn't
 allow me to be around people that are not right for me. I can immediately tell when a person
 or persons are/is not the right company to keep. But as humans, we are sometimes blinded to
 things around us and in cases like this, I seek high intervention from God to remove the people
 from my life who are not in my best interest.</li> 
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<li>Lastly, In Chapter 7, Charlie goes another step further to tell Michael that to be successful
 he would have to be a life-long learner. He expresses that learning does not end by merely completing
 schooling, but he should also think about learning from others who have already succeeded. 
 Charlie also emphasizes reading books regularly to broaden his knowledge. This is a principle that I’ve
 been applying to my college life. I’m not here to just merely collect a certificate of degree but try my
 best to internalize everything that I’m taught. I believe an essential part of this is to ensure that
 whatever you decide to pursue in school should be aligned with the goals you set out to achieve. 
 I also practice learning and observing people who have excelled in my area trying to take in whatever 
 valuable information that presents itself. I haven’t been reading as much as I used to, so this book 
 was a reminder that I need to get the ball rolling again.</li></ol>
